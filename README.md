Ransomware Detection Using Machine Learning  and Deep Learning Models: A Comparative  Analysis

The primary objective of this report is to assess the accuracy of these models and identify key features that contribute to their predictive effectiveness. By conducting a comparative analysis, this work seeks to answer the following questions

Q1– Howaccurate are these ML and DL models in predicting a ransomware attack over a given dataset?
Q2– What are the most influential features that impact the performance of these models?
Q3– How well do these features contribute towards a model’s predictive capabilities?
 
The expected contribution of this work lies in offering insights into each model’s effectiveness and features that influence their performance.
